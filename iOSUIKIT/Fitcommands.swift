 Variables:
 ------------
 Variables allow us to store temporary information in our program
 
 //Once you create a variable using var, you can change it as often as you want
 var name = "Textst"
 
 
 
 
 
 
 What is the mutating Keyword?
 
 In Swift, the mutating keyword is used to declare methods within value types (such as structs and enums) that are allowed to modify the properties of the instance they belong to.
 
 //Examaple : Mutating
  struct Counter {
      var count = 0
      
      mutating func increment() {
          count += 1
      }
  }

  var counter = Counter()
  counter.increment() // This modifies the counter instance
